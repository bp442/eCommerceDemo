# ECommerce Demo
Year Up Capstone 1, a project made for us to practice using HTML along with Bootstrap in order to create a 5 page website that mimics an E-Commerce site. Included in all the pages is a navbar so that navigating the site is simple and easy, and it is stickied to the top of the screen so that it is always available. 

Functionality of the site is nonexistent outside of navigation and page responsiveness. This project was solely to practice using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS in order to create a mockup of an E-Commerce site.

### Home Page
![Home Page](/images/DeviceMonstersHome.jpg)
Standard home page, with a large image of a computer setup to drive home the fact that it's meant to be catered towards gaming, but also can be used for professional tasks. The first image near the top is a slideshow, showing off example builds of gaming PCs with their accessories to show off some products that the store would likely provide. The images included are responsive and will resize themselves depending on the screen size. Included are descriptions of the "company mission" as well as hyperlinks to the products page, the login page, and the registration page.

### User Registration Page
![User Registration Page](/images/DeviceMonstersRegister.png)
At the top of the page is a redirect link to the Login page if you were to already have an account (a common practice in websites), and then a simple email form so that users can enter their preferred login information. Included are all the common practices for registration forms, such as having a password confirmation input as well as a checkbox for whether or not the user would like to receive email newsletters. At the bottom of the form is a radio button list that asks the user how they heard about the site (mandatory for the assignment), with the default option being "I don't want to answer" so that it isn't a hindrance to anyone trying to quickly register.

### User Login Page
![User Login Page](/images/DeviceMonstersLogin.png)
A simple login form, with an email and password input. Included (to differentiate it from the registration page) is a checkbox to remember the users' login info, as well as a redirect towards the registration page if they haven't already made an account.

***
### Products/Services Page
![Products and Services Page](/images/DeviceMonstersProducts.jpg)
A list of the products that the website would offer are listed in a grid format with bootstrap cards to show the products in a cleaner manner.
The cards themselves are responsive and will wrap around into two columns if the page is small, and one column if the page is even smaller than that. A search bar was added at the top of the page because it is typical for an ecommerce site to have a function like that. Each card has an image of the product described as well as a button to add it to a cart (buttons are non-functional).

### Checkout Page
![Checkout Page](/images/DeviceMonstersCheckout.png)
The checkout page is a sample cart with a form to include the users' billing information. The cart itself is a table with custom CSS included that changes the background of the table cells to green if the product is in stock, as well as red if they aren't in stock. The billing information section is a form with placeholders to tell the user exactly how the format of the inputs should be, as well as a checkbox for a legal agreement that is required before the form can be submitted.

#### Things I Learned
This was my first experience using Bootstrap, and I feel as though I learned a lot from this project. The products page specifically was a challenge because it was a learning experience, trying to get every card to layout and respond correctly to each respective screen size. I also had to customize the size and the gap between the items so that it wouldn't look claustrophobic on the screen, and I believe that the resulting webpage both functions and looks as clean as I had intended.
